 #### **Question 1 – Ethnicity - Scott**

 **Does ethnicity have a correlation with mental health awareness and its services and does the correlation also cross reference the amount of physical health services instead?** 
 
 In a very descriptive article, it is observed and collected from data that most mental health problems are geared towards whites within American Indian/Alaskan natives. While the lower rates of mental health problems and the search for health services for mental illnesses or needs is found within the majority of African America, Asian, Mexican, Central and South American and other Hispanic-Latino group. It has also been found that ethnic groups will utilize health care services for physical treatments by physical symptoms. This generates a possibility of escaping the diagnoses of mental problems and hide other underlying mental problems.

#### **Question 2 – Gender - Heather** 

**Does gender affect the duration of service for a client undergoing alcohol treatment?**

An initial review of the literature indicates that individuals who identify as female are more likely to complete an inpatient alcohol treatment program compared to individuals who identify as male. It would be interesting to see if women in Heartland Family Service inpatient alcohol treatment stay in the program longer than men, and if so, decision-makers might look at ways to encourage men to stay in the program longer.

#### **Question 3 – Record_ID - Akhil** 

**How many times a single individual has visited the Heartland family services for Gambling, Substance Use and Mental Health?** 

Knowing the number of visits per person for different age groups might help the decision makers to know the average number of sittings required for an individual to get set for the different programs based on different age groups.
