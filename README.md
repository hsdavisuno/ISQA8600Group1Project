## Contribution Statement

The responsibilities of our final product is as follows for contributors Akhil Kodali, Heather Davis, and Scott Bui. Akhil Kodali handled the last portion of plots we used to present to the client. He refined details in the data and smoothed out any error in the code. Heather Davis contributed to the task of summarizing a 2500 word document on our gathered information and prepared templates for assignments. Scott Bui prepared the PowerPoint Presentation and doing the first look on proofing of documents, the readme contributorship statement was under his responsibility to finish. The team as whole reviewed the document and presentation for final proofing. GitHub links has been updated by Akhil Kodali and submitted for assignments.

The entire project’s  contribution begins with the initial scheduling done by Scott Bui. Milestones and due dates were roughly added to be reviewed by teammates Heather Davis and Akhil Kodali. Heather Davis followed up with a project planning template and Final Draft of our plans. Akhil moved the draft schedule into a final markdown document. This completed the first assignment and goals. With known data the team was able to review, analyze, and clean the data, to take data that was relevant to our research; all team members (Akhil Kodali, Heather Davis, and Scott Bui) were overseeing this portion of the assignment. Akhil Kodali wrote the R code for data cleaning. Heather Davis concentrated on the first draft of the Data Cleaning Documentation. Scott Bui handled proofing the document, updating the ReadMe link and handed in for submission. This completed the data cleaning assignment portion. In the assignment for graphing and plotting our data, the team each created plots for their own research questions. Heather Davis created the first draft of the markdown and Akhil added the remainder of the codes to plot. Akhil Kodali completed the uploaded markdown document to GitHub. Heather Davis proofed the documents, updated the ReadMe with a link, and completed the assignment by submitting it.
